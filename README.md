# Giphy Buttons
A browser-based app that populates the page with relevant gifs (within a restricted ratings range) to the show labeled on the button clicked. The user needs to click on individual gifs to start and stop animation. There is also an option for the user to add another TV show button to the top of the page.

Gifs are provided by the Giphy API. Logic written with jQuery, and styling is custom CSS.
